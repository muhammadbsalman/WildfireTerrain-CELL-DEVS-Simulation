***WILDFIRE TERRAIN SIMULATION***
-There are different simulations with some similar files
-The simulation shows the speed and strengths of a fire based on these environments (diffrentiated by colour)
-The colour codes for various environments are found in the report as well as the .pal file
-The .ma contains the simulation rules as well as the instantiation of the atomic model Wildfire
-The .val contains the initial values for various cells, defining what environment will be there
-macros.inc contains certain conditions to check if a neighbouring cell is on fire, to save space in the .ma file
-The .webm files contains a video of the simulation
-The third simulation is the most complex simulation in terms of state and environment variations

***INTSRUCTIONS TO SIMULATE***
-SIMU.EXE and cygwin1.dll should be in the folder
-Upon running the .BAT file, a .log file will be generated
-The .log, .val, .ma. and .pal files can be uploaded to https://simulationeverywhere.github.io/CD-WebViewer-2.0/index.html
-Click load simulation, Simulation Layer, and then Load widget
-Upon clicking the play button, a simulation in live time can be seen
